After finishing the long answer questions, I started to work on the code. Because I do not have experience with APIs, I started to read online about them. I found articles on how to access API and realized it was similar to access local data, but I still struggled to actually access it. Because of this, I decided to start created the HTML and CSS.

After creating the baseline HTML and CSS, I went back to the API, I formatted the data locally to better understand it and see that there are two properties once the data is turned in to an object, rates and currency. I am interested in the currency, so I first just tried to grab any currency as a test. Since it appears this is not working, I go back to add some styling to my buttons. I used a prominent color from the corresponding country to enhance my buttons. When colors repeated, I went to the next logical color. After adding some styling to my buttons and the page in general, I tried to go back to the javascript. 

I initially just tried to access the data with the API but since I was not having luck, I switched to using locally downloaded data. Also, because the information needed to display is nested, I started off with just trying to display the base property of the data with the first button I have. By doing this I can ensure that I am correctly accessing the data. In theory if I get this to work, I should be able to replicate this with the other buttons and add some additional code to grab the correct info. 

After getting this to work, my next steps would be to add event listeners on the other buttons. Then I would use AJAX to load the data again; however, now I would grab the data corresponding to the correct currency and then display that.
